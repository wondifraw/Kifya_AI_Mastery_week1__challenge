## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of quantitative analysis, time series analysis, and correlation analysis on news datasets using Python libraries such as PyNance, TaLib, and other relevant tools. The goal is to extract insights from news sentiment and examine its relationship with stock market movement.

---

## Features

- Object-oriented, modular, and efficient codebase.
- Quantitative analysis of financial and news data.
- Time series analysis and visualization of news frequency.
- Correlation analysis between news sentiment and stock movement.
- Proactive error handling with informative messages.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for code quality checks.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- TaLib  
- PyNance  
- nltk / TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- pytest
- flake8
---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/wondifraw/week1__challenge.git
        cd week1__challenge
---
## Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
         python3 -m venv venv
         source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
---
## Install the dependencies:
         pip install -r requirements.txt

--- 
## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
2. Navigate to the notebook folder and open EDA_analysis_and_Topic_modelling ipynb.
3. Follow the notebook cells to run quantitative analysis, time series analysis, and correlation studies.

## Data Description
* The dataset consists of news headlines, publication timestamps, and stock price data.
* Data preprocessing includes cleaning, normalization, and timestamp conversion.
* Sentiment analysis is performed using nltk/TextBlob to classify news sentiment.
---
## Analysis Performed
* The code includes try-except blocks to handle file I/O errors, data processing exceptions, and invalid inputs gracefully.
* Informative error messages guide users to troubleshoot issues.
* Unexpected errors trigger clean exits without crashing the program.

## Continuous Integration
  * GitHub Actions are set up to automatically run tests and linters on each commit and pull request.
  * This ensures code quality and prevents regressions.
  * Future plans include deployment automation and integration with cloud platforms.
## Future Work
- Implement additional machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Enhance data visualizations using interactive libraries.
- Expand the dataset for more comprehensive analysis.
